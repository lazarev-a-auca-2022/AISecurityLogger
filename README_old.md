# AI Logger

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Ingestion Layer

Responsible for collecting raw logs from various sources and reliably queuing them for processing.

-   **Components:**
    -   **FluentD (or similar scalable log collector):** Collects logs from diverse sources. Configuration will emphasize robust error handling and buffering.
    -   **Kafka (or other distributed message queue):** Acts as a high-throughput, fault-tolerant message queue to handle varying log volumes and prevent data loss during processing spikes. Scalability and tuning will be prioritized.

### 2. Processing Layer

Focuses on transforming raw logs into structured data and performing initial analysis.

-   **Components:**
    -   **Log Normalization and Structuring Module:** Processes logs from the ingestion layer, normalizing formats and extracting relevant metadata. This module will be designed for scalability.
    -   **Wazuh (or similar SIEM/log analysis platform):** Performs rule-based analysis, acts as a security event and information management system, and provides search capabilities. Integration with the normalization module will ensure structured data is processed.
    -   **AI Analysis Module (FastAPI with Fine-tuned NLP Model, along with Google AI Studio):** Receives structured logs or relevant data extracts. A FastAPI application will manage batch processing for efficiency. The core will be a fine-tuned NLP model specifically trained on security-relevant log data to improve accuracy and reduce false positives/negatives. This module will be designed for horizontal scaling.

### 3. Detection & Correlation Layer

Correlates findings from rule-based analysis (Wazuh) and AI analysis to identify potential threats and generate alerts.

-   **Components:**
    -   **Correlation Engine:** This component will receive outputs from Wazuh alerts and the AI analysis module. It will implement sophisticated correlation rules and logic to identify complex attack patterns.
    -   **Conflict Resolution Mechanism:** A critical part of the correlation engine, designed to handle potential discrepancies between Wazuh and AI findings, prioritizing alerts based on defined confidence levels and rules.

### 4. Storage Layer

Provides persistent storage and indexing for normalized, processed, and analyzed log data.

-   **Components:**
    -   **MyScaleDB (or benchmarked alternative like ClickHouse/Elasticsearch):** Selected based on performance benchmarking for efficient storage, indexing, and querying of large volumes of time-series and structured data. Sharding and indexing strategies will be implemented for optimal performance and scalability.

### 5. Reporting & Presentation Layer

Provides interfaces for viewing alerts, generating reports, and accessing analyzed data.

-   **Components:**
    -   **Reporting Module (e.g., Wazuh Reporting or custom):** Generates comprehensive reports based on detected threats and system activity.
    -   **API and User Interface:** Provides programmatic access to alerts and data, and a user interface for monitoring and investigation.

### 6. Orchestration & Management Layer

Oversees the entire pipeline, managing component health, scaling, configuration, and monitoring.

-   **Components:**
    -   **Orchestration Platform (e.g., Kubernetes):** Manages the deployment, scaling, and health of all microservices and components.
    -   **Monitoring and Alerting System:** Provides visibility into the pipeline's performance, identifies issues, and triggers alerts for operational concerns.

## Data Pipelining

Data flows through the architecture in a clear pipeline:

1.  Raw logs are collected by FluentD and sent to Kafka.
2.  The Processing Layer consumes messages from Kafka. Logs are normalized and structured.
3.  Normalized logs are fed into Wazuh for rule-based analysis and also sent to the AI Analysis Module for deep learning analysis.
4.  Outputs from Wazuh and the AI Analysis Module are sent to the Detection & Correlation Layer.
5.  The Correlation Engine processes these inputs, applies conflict resolution, and generates alerts for identified threats.
6.  Normalized logs, analysis results, and alerts are stored in the Storage Layer.
7.  The Reporting & Presentation Layer accesses data from the Storage Layer and Detection & Correlation Layer to provide reports and a user interface.
8.  The Orchestration & Management Layer monitors and controls all components across the pipeline.

## Roadmap

The development roadmap focuses on building out the layered architecture and addressing key areas for optimization:

1.  **Phase 1: Core Pipeline MVP:** Implement the basic data flow through the Ingestion, Processing (Normalization, initial Wazuh integration), and Storage layers.
2.  **Phase 2: AI Integration:** Integrate the AI Analysis Module with a base NLP model and connect it to the pipeline.
3.  **Phase 3: Detection & Correlation:** Develop the Correlation Engine and Conflict Resolution Mechanism.
4.  **Phase 4: Reporting & UI:** Build out the Reporting & Presentation Layer.
5.  **Phase 5: Optimization and Hardening:**
    -   Conduct comprehensive stress testing and optimize components for scalability (FluentD, Kafka, FastAPI).
    -   Fine-tune or train the NLP model with security-specific data.
    -   Benchmark and finalize the Storage Layer solution (MyScaleDB vs. alternatives).
    -   Refine correlation rules and conflict resolution logic.
    -   Implement robust error handling and monitoring.
6.  **Phase 6: Advanced Features:** Explore alternative architectural patterns (e.g., ELT), integrate external threat intelligence feeds, and enhance AI capabilities.

## Solutions

-   **Scalability:** Utilizing distributed systems like Kafka and designing components for horizontal scaling (FluentD, AI Module, Normalization Module) mitigates bottlenecks under high load. Stress testing is a key roadmap item.
-   **AI Model Accuracy:** The roadmap includes explicit steps for fine-tuning or training the NLP model on security data.
-   **Threat Detection Conflicts:** The dedicated Conflict Resolution Mechanism within the Detection & Correlation Layer is designed to manage disagreements between rule-based and AI findings.
-   **Storage Performance:** Benchmarking storage solutions and implementing proper indexing and sharding strategies ensures efficient data handling.
-   **Diverse Log Formats and Edge Cases:** The Normalization and Structuring Module is responsible for handling various formats, and comprehensive testing is included in the roadmap.
-   **AI Reliability:** Fine-tuning and potential future mechanisms for feedback loops aim to improve AI accuracy and reduce hallucination.
-   **Wazuh API Limitations:** While Wazuh is a component, the architecture allows for alternative data access patterns if API limitations become a significant issue.
-   **Optimal Data for AI:** The architecture allows flexibility in providing either normalized or potentially raw data to the AI module, which can be optimized during development.
-   **Over-reliance on Wazuh:** While integrated, the architecture distributes key functions across layers and includes a separate AI analysis path, reducing single-point dependency.
